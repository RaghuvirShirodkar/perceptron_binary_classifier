## Perceptron Binary Classifier

A naive implementation of a single-neuron neural network binary classifier that learns to distinguish between different data.

### Idea
* Generate random data set.
* Implement single-neuron neural network.
* Plot the distributions and the decision boundary to evaluate the functioning of the NN.
